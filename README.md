# Hackspace Rules

If you are looking for the Draft rules switch to the 'rtd-draft' branch by the button up to the left

These are the rules for Nottingham Hackspace.  If you have spotted something that needs changing, fork the repository and open a pull request.

If you are not comfortable using git, you can always just [raise an issue](https://github.com/NottingHack/rules/issues).
